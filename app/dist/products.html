            Bangkok is one of the most exciting holiday places ever! The capital and most populous city of Thailand is not only a thriving centre of modern city life, but also a place full of ancient history.  Known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep, it features everything that a holiday maker can ask for, from hospitality, fun and excitement to culture and cuisine.<br><br>

            Tokyo is probably the most amazing city of the East. A metropolitian flavour coupled with an easy-going and friendly attitude is what is characteristic about this city. However, unknown to many travellers, there are wonderful landscapes just outside the city borders such as this beautiful lakeside. This year we offer our holiday makers a stay at a resort just 7 miles west from the Tokyo city centre for relaxation, fun and peaceful entertainment.<br><br>
